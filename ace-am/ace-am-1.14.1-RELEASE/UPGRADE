2. Apply any sql patches from the updates directory.
 - run patches in order (example: updating from 1.4 to 1.6)
 mysql> source 1.4-1.4.2.updates.sql;
 mysql> source 1.5-1.6.updates.sql;

3. Remove old versions
  - $TOMCAT/webapps/ace-am
  - $TOMCAT/webapps/ace-am.war
  - $TOMCAT/work/Catalina/localhost/ace-am

4. Drop in new ace-am.war
 - copy ace-am.war to $TOMCAT/webapps/ace-am.war

5. Restart tomcat
 - $TOMCAT/bin/startup.sh or $TOMCAT/bin/startup.bat

-------------------
Notes for specific versions.
 - if updating from versions prior to 1.6, see the 1.6 notes.

1.7
 ACE 1.7 changed how collections are stored. This will require a a migration
to run prior to ace starting up. You MUST install the 1.6-1.7 patch prior
to running ace 1.7. Failure to install the sql patch will result in ace not
starting. This update should take less than a second and you will see log
lines that look similar to:
[05/Aug/2011:12:46:36] [SETTINGS]Found new settings table
[05/Aug/2011:12:46:36] [SETTINGS]Found old column name, migration triggered
...
...
[05/Aug/2011:12:46:38] [SETTINGS]Settings migration successfully finished


1.6
 The 1.6 version changed how the ACE tokens are stored in the database.
When you start the new version after an upgrade, ACE will attempt to
migrate your existing tokens to the new format. This will result in ACE
not being available immediately. Depending on how many files you monitor 
this migration may take several minutes. You can monitor the progress of
an upgrade by looking at the ace log file (/tmp/aceam.log).

You will see lines that look like:
[MIGRATION]Old token table still exists, migration triggered
[MIGRATION]Token Migration starting
...
[MIGRATION]Migrated: 50000/567832 tokens processed: 10000
...
[MIGRATION]Token migration successfully finished

If you have not installed the required sql patches, ace will not start and
you will see the following error in the log file:

[MIGRATION]SQL patch to 1.6+ has not been installed, table 'acetoken' does no exist, shutting down!
